\title{Expected Goals: A Machine Learning Approach to Analyzing Scoring Potential in Hockey}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to analyzing scoring potential in hockey through the use of Expected Goals (xG). We introduce an xG model that incorporates various in-game variables such as shot angle and distance from net to quantify the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and support vector machines, we develop a predictive framework capable of estimating the expected goal value for every shot attempt. Our results demonstrate that this method provides a more accurate and nuanced understanding of scoring potential compared to conventional metrics, offering valuable insights for coaches, analysts, and players to optimize team strategy and individual performance.
